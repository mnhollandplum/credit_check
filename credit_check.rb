# Your Luhn Algorithm Here
## reverse card number
card_number.reverse
## Double every other number
card_number.chars.each 
## if the sum is more than 10 sum the products
## % by 10
## if 0, valid
## else, invalid
# Output

## If it is valid, print "The number is valid!"
## If it is invalid, print "The number is invalid!"
